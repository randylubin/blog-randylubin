Lately I've been using [Voice Dream](http://www.voicedream.com/) to listen to ebooks (credit to [Chris Maury](http://chrismaury.com) for showing it to me). It's an awesome little app that allows you to load any epub, pdf, etc. and it will read it aloud. The voice is a little robotic sounding but I don't mind. The best feature is that you can accelerate the playback speed. Over the first week I had it, I started slow and then worked my way up to the to the max speed of 500 words per minute.

I actually don't mind reading on my phone but Voice Dream allows me to listen during my commute - when I wouldn't be able to read. I've been tearing through a large back-log of reading.

Recently I've been on a sci-fi binge - reading the [Mars Trilogy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mars_trilogy), [Schild's Ladder](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schild%27s_Ladder), and [The Player of Games](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Player_of_Games) - all excellent. Prior to that I read [The Origins of Political Order](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Origins_of_Political_Order) - the book which inspired me to create the  Nation Building game.

The next book I'll read is probably [Antifragile](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antifragile:_Things_That_Gain_from_Disorder) but I'd love some suggestions for what to read next!
