<p>Last post was April 2011...</p>&#13;
<p>This year I'm going to try to blog more frequently.  To lower the barrier to posting, I'm going to aim for my posts to be succinct.</p>&#13;
<p>Some upcoming short posts:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>2011 Recap</li>&#13;
<li>Goals for 2012 (besides blogging more)</li>&#13;
</ul>
