I just created my second post for Future Press Releases:

[Chef Blake Braddock Opens New Restaurant, Qualia](http://futurepressreleases.tumblr.com/post/109213444916/chef-blake-braddock-opens-new-restaurant-qualia)

The gist is that patrons agree to follow the chef's instructions for the day leading up to the meal, so that they're in the best position to experience it.
