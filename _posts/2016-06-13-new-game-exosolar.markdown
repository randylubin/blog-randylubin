<p>I’m excited to announce another new game: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10kP5xsZkmmZdgKok7ygPtg7jejl_Swh_FwA2u6TgSD0/edit?usp=sharing">Exosolar</a></p><p>It’s a rules-light RPG focusing on a group of robots trying to survive on a hostile planet.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="959" data-orig-width="1122"><img src="/images/e2c7f2a6832f30d8007ce7bbda1023d7bdb7c8a6825014c628d4d90761fb7085.png" data-orig-height="959" data-orig-width="1122"></figure><p>I made Exosolar game for <a href="http://www.game-chef.com/2016/06/03/your-2016-theme-and-ingredients-are/">Game Chef</a>,&nbsp;an annual game design competition. This year the theme was technology and each game had to include at least two of the following “ingredients”: sunlight, sketch, dance, alarm. From start to end, designers have only 9 days.</p><p>This was my first year competing and it was a blast!</p><p>I wrote most of the rules this morning and got in a playtest this afternoon. My players created some awesome robots and did a great job establishing a base. By the end of the game, they were well on their way to creating a dyson sphere.<br></p><p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10kP5xsZkmmZdgKok7ygPtg7jejl_Swh_FwA2u6TgSD0/edit?usp=sharing">Check it out</a> and let me know what you think!</p>
