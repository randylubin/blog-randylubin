description: Go play the sequel to Sherlock Holmes Consulting Detective!

<p>A few years ago I stumbled across my grandfather’s copy of <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/2511/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-thames-murder">Sherlock Holmes: Consulting Detective</a>. It’s an amazing collaborative mystery solving game which I wrote about in an <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/post/103443517593/sherlock-holmes-consulting-detective-game">earlier post</a>.</p><p>Avital and I just played the first mystery of the sequel,&nbsp;<a href="http://amzn.to/2tiuFfL">Jack the Ripper &amp; West End Adventures</a>, and it’s off to a great start! The production values are incredible: the map, directory, and newspapers are high quality and each case has it’s own booklet. The first case was on the easy side but we also caught a lucky break.</p><p>I highly recommend checking it out, but if you haven’t played the original you might as well do that first!</p>
