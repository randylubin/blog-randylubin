<h2>What Codecademy Has Backwards</h2>&#13;
<p><em>Quick disclaimer: Codecademy is only five months old and have way more to build than the current staff has bandwidth to achieve.  I have tons of respect for their progress so far and can't wait to see how they evolve.</em></p>&#13;
<p>I'm extremely pleased with the popularity of Codecademy  / CodeYear.  Many of my friends are finally learning CS and will soon be able to create their own basic web apps.  Alas, the current CodeYear method has one thing backwards: projects are an afterthought.</p>&#13;
<p>The current set up has lessons/concepts as the main focus of each week's course with a related (optional) project at the end.  I think this should be inverted, with everything revolving around projects.</p>&#13;
<p>I started learning CS through Stanford's 106A course (more info <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/post/2461663434/learning-to-code">here</a>), which was almost entirely project based.  Each week would bring a new challenge; by the third week (the third day of my time working through it) the task was to build the classic game: Breakout.</p>&#13;
<p><img align="middle" alt="Breakout" height="329" src="http://i.imgur.com/L3OKV.jpg" width="408" /></p>&#13;
<p>To be able to build a full, fun game so early in the course was a blast.  I enjoyed the learning process as I was excited about the end product.  Each lesson made more sense because I knew why I needed the concepts.  I was highly motivated to continue the program.</p>&#13;
<p>Codecademy (and other code courses) could gain much by emulating this structure.</p>&#13;
<p>I think the ideal lesson set-up would be something like this:</p>&#13;
<ol><li>Show the student an interactive, working version of the finished project (ideally something fun)</li>&#13;
<li>Explain why they can't complete the project with their current skill set - identify the new concepts they need to learn (this provides context)</li>&#13;
<li>Teach the new concepts through interactive modules (CodeYear currently does this well)</li>&#13;
<li>Coach the student through completing the project with their newly learned skills</li>&#13;
<li>Enable the student to customize/personalize the project</li>&#13;
<li>Let the user share what they've built with others</li>&#13;
</ol><p>I think this method will result in higher user engagement and better retention of the concepts by the students. Also *hint hint* if users are sharing their projects, they are likely to bring new users to the site.</p>&#13;
<h2>Three Other Recommendations for Codecademy</h2>&#13;
<p>In addition to the lessons on programming concepts, there are three other modules which I'd love to see posted (sooner than later).  They are key to becoming a well rounded coder.</p>&#13;
<h3>Debugging</h3>&#13;
<p>Bugs are an inevitable part of coding, especially for a novice.  An early unit on best practices for quashing bugs would be immensely useful.  Stanford has a great handout  <a href="http://see.stanford.edu/materials/icspmcs106a/33-debugging.pdf">here</a>.</p>&#13;
<h3>Problem Decomposition</h3>&#13;
<p>Stanford also did a great job of teaching how one should tackle a new problem.  Decomposition (breaking problems into smaller, bite size, and easily testable pieces) is a key skill that every aspiring coder should hone.</p>&#13;
<h3>Googling (i.e. quickly finding answers)</h3>&#13;
<p>As a novice coder, you will constantly run into odd errors and concepts you don't understand.  Being able to quickly find the answers is essential to maintaining a projects momentum.  A module on this topic should also cover Stack Overflow and "How to read through documentation"</p>
