<p>Roommate <a href="http://chrismaury.com/">Chris Maury</a> recently grabbed the board game <a href="http://www.boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/38453/space-alert">Space Alert</a> for his birthday and it just might be the most fun board game I've ever played.</p>&#13;
<p>The general concept is that the players on crew on a space mission and need to survive for 10 minutes. The style is cooperative - everyone works together and you win or lose as a group.</p>&#13;
<p>The 10 minutes are played out in real time and there is an MP3 describing everything that goes wrong: alien attacks, malfunctions, intruders, etc. The players than have to run around the ship and take action by playing cards from their hands.</p>&#13;
<p>After the ten minutes you look back over what each player did and then you get to find out whether you survived or not. There've been a few times that we thought we won but later found out that a damage prevented us from firing a crucial laser shot.</p>&#13;
<p>The ten minute real time phase is chaotic and demands high coordination and communication among the players; it's challenging and a lot of fun. The recap after is a little tedious by hand but luckily there's a great Flash application which resolves it all for you; there are even funny animations of your players running around.</p>&#13;
<p>I've now played it with 2, 3, and 5 players and on multiple difficulties; I'm confident in saying it's the best game I've played and perfect for any size group.</p>&#13;
