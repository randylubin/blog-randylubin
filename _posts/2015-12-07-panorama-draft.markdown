<p>I’m excited to share an early draft of Panorama - my new game. Panorama is a collaborative worldbuilding game focused on exploring a specific time and place. All you need to play are the rules and some index cards.</p><p>The rules are in <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/196biB_Vu8OoiipHMYvR_FdoqLCE-pJ3wdRP1B_qbyNk/edit?usp=sharing">this Google Doc</a> - I’ve enabled comments.</p><p>I’m still developing the game and I’d love feedback on the gameplay and the writing of the rules. You can comment directly on the document, on this blog post, or email me at randylubin@gmail.com</p>
