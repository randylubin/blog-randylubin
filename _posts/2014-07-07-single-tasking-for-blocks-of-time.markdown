description: Single Tasking for Blocks of Time
---

After a week of readjusting to SF life, it's time to get productive. One tactic I'm going to try is setting aside serious blocks of time to work on _just one thing_.

My days are often punctuated with little meetings, calls, side trips, etc that are horrible for getting serious work / thinking done. I'm going to start blocking off half-days (maybe three hour chunks) to working without interruption. I'll dedicate these blocks to just one thing - I'm hoping the single-tasking will aid in focus and productivity.

I'll likely experiment with then the optimal time of day during which I can be most productive. I will post my results here!
