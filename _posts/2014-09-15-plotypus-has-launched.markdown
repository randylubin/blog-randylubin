description: Plotypus Has Launched!

I'm am very pleased to announce that I've launched [Plotypus](http://plotypus.com/) - the collaborative story telling card game I've been developing this year. See [this post](http://blog.randylubin.com/post/95053299523/plotypus-collaborative-storytelling-card-game) for an overview of the game.

Launching means that I've finalized the designs and created a [website for it](http://plotypus.com/). I'm sharing the designs as a Creative Commons Licensed [PDF](http://plotypus.com/print.html) which you can print at home (or through [Print & Play Productions](http://www.printplaygames.com/)).

I'm really happy with how the game turned out! I'll be doing a small batch print run for friends and family. If you're interested, fill out [this form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/11JkmwRjOYLij3mYyOxODymbVG3jB3fj5bhIpfKU5QB8/viewform?usp=send_form); it'll be $15 and I'll mail it within the US.

Next steps are up in the air. I'm keen to hear back from players on how I can improve the game and manual. If there is interest, I'd like to Kickstart a version with professionally designs and I have a bunch of expansion packs in mind.
