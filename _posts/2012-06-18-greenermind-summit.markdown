<p>I was away at the <a href="http://www.greenermindsummit.com/">Greenermind Summit</a> (GMS) this weekend and don't have the time/energy to write the next article in my Fixing Unemployment series... hopefully I'll squeeze in as a midweek post.</p>&#13;
<p>GMS was a blast - lots of amazing people discussing fascinating ideas at the forefront of sustainability, collaborative consumption, etc. I look forward to continuing the conversations over the coming months.</p>&#13;
<p>The style for much of it was Unconference - the topics / sessions were chosen the night before by the participants. Whomever suggests a topic acts as facilitator for conversation and the topics can be fluid and evolve in response to attendee interest. I mostly enjoyed this format but often felt it could benefit from having more experts.</p>&#13;
<p>I facilitated a session on Collaborative Production - I look forward to sharing that thinking in a future post.</p>
