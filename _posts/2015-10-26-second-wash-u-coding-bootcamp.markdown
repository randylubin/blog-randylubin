I just got back from running my second coding bootcamp at Washington University and it was great but exhausting.

We had 40 students, a mixture of MBA and undergrad. Our goal was to get them excited about coding, learn some html and css fundamentals and walk away having built a personal website.

Overall I think it went very well - most of the students quickly latched on to the concepts and I think many will continue learning to code!
