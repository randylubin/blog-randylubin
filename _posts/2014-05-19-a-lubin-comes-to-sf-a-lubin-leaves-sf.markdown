It's an exciting week! My brother Greg just arrived in SF. He just wrapped up his sophomore year at Wash U and is spending his second summer interning in tech in SF! Last summer was amazing and I'm looking forward to living and collaborating with him again this year. You can follow his blog at [greglubin.com](greglubin.com)

However, much like last year, I'm deserting him in the beginning of the summer for international adventure. This Wednesday I leave for Nepal / India. The trip is still shaping up but it's going to be incredible. As always, I'll be blogging whenever I have internet.

I'll be back at the end of June - should be amazing!
