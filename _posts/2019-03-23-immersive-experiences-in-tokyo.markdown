description: Immersive Experiences in Tokyo
---

<p>I’ve been excited to discover Japan’s immersive / interactive theater scene and there’s been scant information on the English web. This week we tried two immersive experiences: <a href="https://borderless.teamlab.art/">TeamLab Borderless</a> and <a href="https://www.shochiku.co.jp/pj/kabukinohikari/">The Lighting Art of Kabuki</a><br></p><h2>TeamLab Borderless</h2><div>Borderless was an extremely high production value immersive space spread over two floors and myriad exhibits. Most exhibits involved interesting animated art projected on walls with varying degrees of interactivity.<br></div><p></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="/images/f6590d23d26a969033d096f92f5c505b95841f688767fea0b58492bb0874dc06.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"></figure><p>One highlight was a tea room where digital flowers grow out of your tea cup and the petals flow around the room.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="/images/73920bdf10a95155d9c70c782dfedc5a0b4a230cc672125c81075591825518b1.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"></figure><p>There was a mirrored room with dozens of synchronized spotlights that danced around and reacted to the attendees.<br></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="/images/7653fe878675e5ec50a00f14cfbc458dd860c0c4bcf91c54dd54df1959b00054.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"></figure><p>And a hybrid virtual and analog town where the roads and rails would rearrange themselves as you moved around buildings.</p><p>Almost all of our friends raved about their visits to Borderless. Although I enjoyed it, I didn’t love it. I would have appreciated more narrative, more integration across installations, and even more interactivity. Overall though great to see experimentation on this scale!<br><br></p><h2>The Lighting and Art of Kabuki</h2><div>This was a small exhibit in Shibuya where a team of artists retold a classic Kabuki story through interactive digital means. The focused on a few key beats of the story and used a different interactive mechanism for each.<br><br></div><p></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="/images/329276b5cb15aae6821d633b334917e925cd1911be552178798e5591520fc34a.png" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1024"></figure><p>In one area, we carried lanterns (tea lights on top of Vive controllers) which illuminated a scene animated through shadows. The shadows reacted in real-time to us moving around the lantern, which was a pretty cool effect.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="/images/ba3cc2b31f92e485b07f9dc7ab4ea08c45f816d56eba1d983bdb77aecfafa170.png" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="1024"></figure><p>Another allowed audience members to puppeteer characters and make them dance around (using Kinect), while a third area used holographic pedestals to let folks play a virtual drum.<br><br>Overall, the experience felt more like a string of thematically linked tech demos than a narratively coherent interactive experience but it was still nice to check out.<br><br>We’ll be looking for more interactive experiences to check out so let us know if you find any!</p>
