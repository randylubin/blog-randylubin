description: "Criteria for choosing projects"
---
My weeks are filled with opportunities to brainstorm, build, and collaborate. Recently, I've thought a bit abut the criteria I use to choose to be productive. Here's some of my filtering:

**Brainstorms:** I thoroughly enjoy exploring ideas. I'll brainstorm with most people about almost any idea - as long as it's not too malicious / evil.

**Small Projects:** There are many reasons I'll dive into small projects (weekend hacks or slightly larger). It could be to learn a new concept / framework, to create something awesome, to enjoy the process, or to collaborate with someone great. If the project strongly hits one of the buckets or moderately hits several, I'm likely to engage.

**Start-up Ideas:** I'm much more discerning about exploring ideas around which I might found a company (and raise funding). Some of my criteria include:

1.  Large addressable market: one of my professors is fond of saying "It takes as much energy to start a small business as a giant one"
2.  Solving a real problem: increases chances for success and my own motivation
2.  Positive social impact: I believe that if you have the capacity to change the world, you have an obligation to try
3.  Interesting; something I get excited about for _years_
4.  "But for" causation: if it's likely to happen without me, I'm less motivated to build it; I consider the problem "solved"
