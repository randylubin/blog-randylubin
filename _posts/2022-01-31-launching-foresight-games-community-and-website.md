title: 'Launching: Foresight Games community and website'
description: Announcing a new site and community for practitioners of foresight games

---
I'm in the process of building a website and community for games that explore the future.

It will be at [Foresight.Games](http://foresight.games) and it will likely include:

* The Foresight.Games website with information on related games, game designers, consultants, and facilitators
* A community hub, likely in Slack or Discord
* A series of events, including talks, workshops, and playtests

If you're interested in participating or learning more, [fill out this form](https://forms.gle/6jiW5fsgRUiBhySK9) and I'll reach out with more info.
