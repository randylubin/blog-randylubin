<p>Earlier this week, Hamish McKenzie had an <a href="http://pandodaily.com/2012/04/20/lets-build-a-future-without-cars/" target="_blank">interesting article</a>&nbsp;on a future without cars. &nbsp;The article lays out a great vision but lacks near term solutions. &nbsp;Here's one which could go a ways in eliminating the need for cars.&nbsp;</p>
<p><img alt="Shuttle" height="265" src="http://i.imgur.com/Ka2ry.jpg" width="388"></p>
<h2>The Vision</h2>
<p>A service which marries the ease and&nbsp;convenience&nbsp;of <a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a>&nbsp;with the low cost of <a href="https://www.supershuttle.com/">Super Shuttle</a>. &nbsp;You would be able to call a shuttle through an iPhone app and it will show up at your location in minutes. &nbsp;The shuttle will then whisk you to your destination with only a few slight detours along the way (to drop off other passengers). &nbsp;While slightly slower than grabbing a cab, it would be much more affordable.</p>
<h2>The Assumptions</h2>
<h3>Demand</h3>
<p>Many people own cars because they lack access to an affordable substitute. &nbsp;Public transportion may not be near nor run often enough. &nbsp;Taxis may be too expensive to use as frequently as necessary. &nbsp;The success of <a href="http://www.zipcar.com/">Zipcar</a>&nbsp;may indicate that people will forgo car ownership if decent alternatives exist.</p>
<p>While not as&nbsp;convenient&nbsp;as a taxi, these shuttles are much more&nbsp;convenient&nbsp;than busses as they will take you directly to your destination and will arrive on demand. &nbsp;People will accept delays to pick up others, so long as the price is right and the delays are minors.</p>
<p>Here is a look at the possible Cost / Quality curve:</p>
<p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="353" data-orig-width="500"><img src="/images/b37ff25ed6e515cc42b76e175383c70851896e5e00af67e9d0915eb5a2a652ac.png" data-orig-height="353" data-orig-width="500"></figure></p>
<p>This service could cannibalize:</p>
<ul><li>Taxi users who care more about cost than speed</li>
<li>Bus users who care more about&nbsp;convenience&nbsp;than cost</li>
<li>Car owners who can't afford taxis regularly but need more convenience than busses</li>
</ul><div>That is a lot of potential users.</div>
<div></div>
<h3>Costs &amp; Revenues</h3>
<p>The economic viability depends on asset utilization which would be driven by customer density. &nbsp;In other words, there needs to be enough users to keep the shuttles reasonably full without making major detours.</p>
<p>Compared with taxis, the costs related to gas should be only modestly higher and the driver's wages about the same. &nbsp;The cost/hour/vehicle&nbsp;will only be slightly higher than taxis yet be spread across many passengers. &nbsp;This would allow the service to charge dramatically less than taxis.</p>
<p>I haven't run the numbers but I suspect the charge to the user would be much closer to public transit than taxi usage. &nbsp;This low cost, combined with the&nbsp;convenience&nbsp;factor, might be a tempting enough for people to give up their cars.</p>
<h3>Technical Ability</h3>
<p>A key element to the success is efficient routing. &nbsp;If users enter their end destination when they call the shuttle (from the app), an&nbsp;algorithm&nbsp;should be able to route the shuttles to users in a way that minimizes overall delay experienced by any given user.</p>
<p>I don't think the algorithm would be that difficult to build but it's success would be&nbsp;dependent&nbsp;on an active enough user base to&nbsp;effectively&nbsp;optimize. &nbsp;If users are too spread out, either the delays will be too long or average number of passengers too low.</p>
<h2>Potential Considerations</h2>
<p>Because this hinges on density, the service would need to grow quickly to reach an efficient scale. &nbsp;A city by city rollout, accompanied by a marketing blitz, is most likely to achieve success. &nbsp;If the minimum&nbsp;efficient&nbsp;scale is high enough - some cities may only support one firm, resulting in a natural monopoly.</p>
<p>It is less clear whether such a system would work in the suburbs as they may lack the density to reach efficiency. &nbsp;It may be the case that it works only if 75% of a town's residents use the service instead of a car.</p>
<p>Partnerships could exist which could lower costs. &nbsp;For example, a grocery store may offer to pay half a user's fare if the shuttle brings them to the store. &nbsp;An San Francisco grocer already offers free rides home - an indication that this model could work.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I really like this idea and think it could work; I'd&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;use it! &nbsp;It's not something I'd build myself - I lack the&nbsp;authenticity&nbsp;and passion to see it through - but I hope someone builds it. &nbsp;Uber may be the best candidate, as they start seeking new customer segments.</p>
<p>Do you think it would work? &nbsp;Would you use it? &nbsp;Let me know in the comments...</p>
