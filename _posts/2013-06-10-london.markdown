I'm heading to London this week as part of [ungroundedthinking.com](http://ungroundedthinking.com)

You can read more about the trip through that link but the short of it:  British Airways is flying out 100 entrepreneurs from the Bay Area to brainstorm ways to change the world.

I'll be staying through the 23rd and taking a mid-week trip to Edinburgh for fun. I'll try to blog about it while in country but probably won't make time for the daily posts, like my last few trips.

I'm incredibly excited for this - it'll be my first time back in London since I lived there in 2008.
