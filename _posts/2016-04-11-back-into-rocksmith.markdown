<p>The past few weeks I’ve gotten back into Rocksmith 2014, the guitar video game you play with an actual guitar. I first got the game over two years ago and <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/post/66654578147/review-rocksmith-2014">wrote a review</a>.</p><p>I haven’t played much the past few months, though I’m not sure way. On a whim, I reinstalled the game and moved my guitar and bass so they’re right next to my computer and always plugged in. There’s now almost no friction to start playing.</p><p>I’ve been playing about a song or two per day and it’s been great. I still think it’s one of the best breaks from work and I go back re-energized. There’s also a ton of new songs available across many genres so there’s something for everyone.</p><p>If you already play guitar or are looking to learn, check it out!</p>
