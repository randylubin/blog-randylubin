description: Farewell AWS/EC2
---

<p>After several years of using AWS for my projects and website hosting I’ve decided not to renew my EC2 instance.</p><p>I’ve migrated almost everything to Github Pages and / or Firebase and there’s rarely a need to for an actual server. There were only two projects I had to shut down: Acting Karaoke and the Reddit Karma Visualizer. The code is all up on GitHub and I might bring them back someday.</p><p>Having my own server was a good experience - it forced me to learn the command line, Node.js, and server architecture. That said - I really like the idea of <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/serverless.html">serverless architecture</a>&nbsp;and would be happy if I never needed a server again!</p>
