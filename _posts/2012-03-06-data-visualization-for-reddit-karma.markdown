description: "Data Visualization for Reddit Karma"
---
<p>I'm happy to announce the soft launch of the data visualization app that I've been building with&nbsp;<a href="http://www.chrismaury.com">Chris Maury</a>. &nbsp;We're still doing minor tweaks, so it may change. &nbsp;Also- we need a name for it and would love any suggestions!</p>
<p><strike>We're hosting the demo version here: <a href="karma.randylubin.com">karma.randylubin.com</a></strike></p><p><i>The site is down indefinitely</i></p>
<h2>About The Site</h2>
<p><a href="http://www.reddit.com">Reddit</a>&nbsp;has been around for years but it's growth has exploded over the past year. &nbsp;It now gets over two billion pageviews per month; thats crazy!</p>
<p>A key part of the site is Karma, the points a user gets when others vote up a link or comment. &nbsp;There is an immense amount of data on Reddit; we thought it would be fun to create cool visualizations of the information.</p>
<p>Our first (hopefully of many) visualizations is to show a user's Karma, broken down by the subreddit (topic) in which they receive it.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of mine:</p>

<h2>Building The Site</h2>
<p>The site was fairly easy to build but was a nice culmination of what I've been teaching myself. &nbsp;You can see (and fork) the code <a href="https://github.com/Omnivac/karma_by_subreddit">on GitHub</a>. &nbsp;Here's a brief overview of the technology stack:</p>
<ul><li>Server: NodeJS</li>
<li>Framework: ExpressJS</li>
<li>Template Engine: Jade</li>
<li>Design: Twitter's Bootstrap and some custom jQuery</li>
</ul><p><strike>Again, here's the link:&nbsp;<a href="karma.randylubin.com">karma.randylubin.com</a></strike></p>
<p>Any feedback (or help with a name) is greatly appreciated... use the comments below.</p>
