Following on [this post](http://blog.randylubin.com/post/91717539753/rogue-like-card-game)

I came up with a quick set of rules to start testing my card game rouge-like via Munchkins. I filtered the monsters treasures into four 'levels' of the dungeon and added a health and revised combat system.

I play-tested with my brother and we found that the hero scales much too fast and later monsters don't pose a challenge. Further, we found there was a clearly dominant strategy which doesn't lead to fun gameplay.

For the next test, I'm going to play with the combat system some more and try to add some time pressure for single player (e.g. a countdown timer before the dungeon collapses).
