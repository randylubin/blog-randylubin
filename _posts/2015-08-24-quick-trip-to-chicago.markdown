I was there for a close friendâ€™s wedding but was able to sneak in some tourism, too.</p><p>We arrived on Thursday and went to the Aviary / Next. Next is a high end restaurant that has a different theme every four months. This month was Spanish Tapas. We had an awesome meal with some very unusual dishes.</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="768"><img src="/images/36c701e6be35fc20b5eac3868052750ef52ee26fe61c2152842d9a10da717e0f.png" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="768"></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="768"><img src="/images/a8803f8a0db01f2333ce412c7b863f89d851116ae5f90025864de4285f8717eb.png" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="768"></figure><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="768"><img src="/images/b59dfb5174f6bf2cec2132f1b68e34bae8193c76b819da27e82d994fe587a12f.png" data-orig-height="1024" data-orig-width="768"></figure><p>On Friday we walked around downtown and took an architecture tour on the river.

The groomsman preparation was fun, the ceremony was moving, and the party was a blast!</p>
