I just started a new Tumblr, [Future Press Releases](http://futurepressreleases.tumblr.com/) which will be a collection of fictional corporate memos, marketing, and PR. I'll use it as a fun creative outlet and place for design fiction and probably cross-post my entries here.

The first post up is a [PR announcment from Gravitas Industries](http://futurepressreleases.tumblr.com/post/108366094371/gravitas-industries-enters-terrestrial-markets), maker of artificial gravity generators for space stations / ships. They've recently created a smaller, cheaper version of their tech and are looking at new ways to productize it. The inspiration came from wondering why sci-fi sometimes introduces a gravity generator and then never discusses other ways it could be used.

Let me know if you want to contribute!
