description: My brother returns to SF
---

<p>I'm very excited to share that my brother Greg has just moved back to SF. He's between his Junior and Senior year at Wash U and, for the third summer in a row, is interning with a startup. The last few summers together have been awesome and I’m looking forward to another great one.</p><p>This summer he's interning with <a href="http://www.peek.com/">Peek</a>&nbsp;and doing a mix of coding and business. I’m hoping we collaborate on a few fun projects this time around. He’ll be blogging again as part of Iron Blogger, hopefully starting next week. You can find his blog here:&nbsp;<a href="http://greglubin.com/">http://greglubin.com/</a></p>
