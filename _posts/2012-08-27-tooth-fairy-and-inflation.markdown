<p>I was going to write out a short story for this week but ran out of time. Instead I'll provide a quick overview of where it might have gone...</p>&#13;
<p>Premise: it would explore the impact of the tooth fairy injecting money into the economy by leaving it under pillows.</p>&#13;
<div>&#13;
<ul><li>In enough quantity, this may cause inflation</li>&#13;
<li>The end of high inflation toward the end of the '70s (80's?) was due to increased fluoride in the water</li>&#13;
<li>Hyperinflation such as in South American nations or the Weimar Republic were due to the introduction of new candy bars into those regions</li>&#13;
<li>The Federal Reserve coordinates with the tooth fairy / dental associations to adjust money supply</li>&#13;
<li>The tooth fairy is the best way out of any recession - giving more money to kids who lose teeth does a great job of stimulating demand</li>&#13;
</ul><p>That's all I have for now... I might revisit it later if I have the time or inclination</p>&#13;
