description: Just Signed Up for 23andMe
---

<p>I've just signed up for <a href="https://www.23andme.com">23andMe</a>, the personal genomics company; I'm very excited.</p>&#13;
<p>Here's how it works:</p>&#13;
<ol><li>They mail me a vial for a spit sample and I send it back</li>&#13;
<li>Their lab analyzes my DNA across ~100,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)</li>&#13;
<li>I receive results in 2-3 weeks</li>&#13;
</ol><p>The results include info on my ancestry, potential disease risks as I age, carrier status for inherited diseases, and estimates for how I'll respond to different drugs.</p>&#13;
<p>I'm a big fan of the quantified self movement, though I haven't practiced much of it myself. This will be my first serious foray into analyzing myself. I'd love to do a full genome sequence but it's still too expensive. The method 23andMe uses, SNPs, still provides a lot of information and will hopefully lead to some cool insights.</p>&#13;
<p>I'll definitely do an update here once I get my results and might share the results themselves - depending on how I feel about privacy.</p>
