<p>The second episode of my podcast, Jamming on Games, is up!</p><p><a href="http://www.jammingongames.com/e/359653ebf61f48/">Episode 2: Biosensors</a></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="350" data-orig-width="350"><img src="/images/5e04169fc7b473b055ec4e4842d70ac038188bb6219711c95113a722f67a0582.png" data-orig-height="350" data-orig-width="350"></figure><p><br>I have Nathan Maton on and we talk about using biosensor data in storytelling games.
