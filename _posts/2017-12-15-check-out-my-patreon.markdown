description: Check out my Patreon!
---

<p>Last week I started a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/randylubin">Patreon</a> to support my game design hobby. I’ve loved designing games over the last few years and this will help me make more, better games. You can help me by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/randylubin">pledging as little as $1</a> per game and you’ll get to join the design process – I’d deeply appreciate it!</p><h2>What is Patreon?</h2><p>Patreon is a site that let’s fans directly support creators (artists, writers, etc). The creator can choose to make pledges per month or per unit of output – I went with per game and will likely release a game every three months.</p><p>Patreon also allows rewards for different pledge levels. For me – any pledge will get free access to games I release and get an inside look at the design process. Higher rewards get at-cost copies of the physical design, input on what I work on next, and game design consulting sessions with me.</p><p>Finally, Patreon let’s you set goals for the overall pledge level. I’ve already hit my first goal of $100 per game, so I’ll do regular video chats where I update folks on my progress and answer questions. I’m excited to someday hit the $250 goal so that I can commission art for each game.</p><h2>Final Thoughts</h2><p>I’m thrilled to have this live and I’m looking forward to using the rewards to make better games with the help of my fans. I don’t intend to become a full-time designer but this will help me dedicate a little more time and money to a hobby I love!</p><p>Again, you can check out my Patreon here:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.patreon.com/randylubin">https://www.patreon.com/randylubin</a></p>
