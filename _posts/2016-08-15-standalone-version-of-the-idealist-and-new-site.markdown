<p>I just broke out my game <a href="http://diegeticgames.com/game_files/The_Idealist.pdf">The Idealist</a> into its own downloadable file and gave <a href="http://diegeticgames.com/condemned/">Condemned</a> its own page on <a href="http://diegeticgames.com/">Diegetic Games</a>.</p><p>I actually didnâ€™t get to playtest The Idealist until <b>after</b>&nbsp;the competition but it played exactly as I hoped. We created interesting progressive characters in a fantasy city where the elvish elite were sapping the residents energy. The characters started out as reformers but slowly sacrificed all of their values in the quest for power - just the arc I wanted!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="813" data-orig-width="1054"><img src="/images/31e0151f4f735ff3e26d141541c67f9367dd21dee08edfee1da5f1db1d34da11.png" data-orig-height="813" data-orig-width="1054"></figure>
