<p>Last night a few friends and I got to play <a href="http://bullypulpitgames.com/games/ghost-court/">Ghost Court</a> in a US Federal Courtroom - it was amazing!</p><figure data-orig-width="1144" data-orig-height="687" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/images/819db2b0f8347748e068d800b648fc0e4a38d5962eb4b9d9ab26c96599253e7b.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1144" data-orig-height="687"></figure><p>Ghost Court is a wonderful storytelling game that’s basically Judge Judy, with ghosts. It comes with 30 matched Plaintiff / Defendant cases that provide context for each case and a paragraph of info to help the players. Each party then gets one minute to state their case and then the judge has three minutes to ask questions before rendering a verdict.</p><figure data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="768" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/images/9323494b15ff51d685de26ee7aaa5a04784e88f9b2a2610cb21972a6ef19c015.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="768"></figure><p>The cases are a mix of humans and ghosts and they’re all great set-ups. The format is perfect for beginner roleplayers / larper – many of our players had never done something like this before. Everyone did a great job of getting into character and we were cracking up the whole time!</p><figure data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="768" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/images/afa2067378980ff9c99c3f7976b425d7594338bfe74b243b9b7b04038c179f3b.png" alt="image" data-orig-width="1024" data-orig-height="768"></figure><p>I highly recommend checking out Ghost Court, even if you don’t have a Federal Courtroom on hand!</p>
