<p>This afternoon I held a playtest event with some other game designers. We tested three games and it was a blast!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"><img src="/images/dc62c40258c1ef8f2e9aec77da2e232a430c4329c115aa433fc01c9a031a7354.png" data-orig-height="768" data-orig-width="1024"></figure><p>I tested Panorama again, this time with some minor rule changes. Our setting was a deserted planet, full of ancient ruins, on the fringe of known space. The tourists and archeologists had recently been stranded there (the spaceport became non-functional) and folks were coping with being stuck.</p><p>I had a lot of fun and got great feedback from the other playtesters. They all enjoyed the game and were excited about the world building. They also had great, tactical feedback about which parts they liked and which they wanted more from. I’m going to make a few rule tweaks and then post a draft of the rules later this week.</p><p>These playtest events have been amazing at forcing me to rewrite the rules and gain feedback. I’m hoping to make them a monthly occurrence and keep growing the community!</p>
