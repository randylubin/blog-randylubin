<p>We decided to pass on more Kyoto shrines and caught an early train to Hiroshima. I continue to be amazed at speed and efficiency of the Shinkansen (bullet train) - we covered a huge chunk of the country in under two hours.</p>&#13;
<p>After dropping our bags off at the hotel we hopped back on the train for a day trip to Miyajima - an island not far from Hiroshima. The island is home to the famous Itsukushima Shrine with its floating Torii gate. Here's a shot from within the shrine:</p>&#13;

<p>After touring the shrine we decided to hike Mt. Misen at the center of the island; an ~1,800 foot climb. We took the long route up but it was definitely worth it. The forest was gorgeous and there were some cool shrines along the way.</p>&#13;

<p>The view at the top was also spectacular; there was a clear view of the entire region.</p>&#13;

<p>We took a gondola back down from the top and caught a final view of the floating torii lit up at night.</p>&#13;

<p>We'll probably take it easy tonight and then explore downtown Hiroshima tomorrow morning. In the afternoon we're heading to a mountain town we're we'll be staying overnight; there won't be wifi so it'll probably be a few days before I post again.</p>
