<p>I’ve been learning InDesign and my first project was to redesign my RPG Hackers and Hustlers. The InDesign learning curve wasn’t too bad and I had a lot of fun with it. I also designed a new micro-site for the game.</p><ul><li>Here is my <a href="http://diegeticgames.com/blog/2016/07/24/hackers-and-hustlers-rpg.html">quick post on Diegetic Games</a><br></li><li>The new <a href="http://diegeticgames.com/hackers_and_hustlers_rpg/">mirco-site</a><br></li><li>The <a href="http://diegeticgames.com/game_files/hackers_and_hustlers_rpg.pdf">game file</a><br></li></ul><figure data-orig-width="450" data-orig-height="450" class="tmblr-full"><img src="/images/11f2b6dfa90d6c4af314774521dad1788eb8eec46ce3f4ed038189bcc1446585.jpg" data-orig-width="450" data-orig-height="450"></figure>
