<p>I'm excited to announce that I'm joining <a href="http://meetings.io/">Meetings.io</a> as the COO.</p>&#13;
<p>While consulting has been fun, I've kept an eye out for an amazing team with an incredible vision. I've found it in Meetings.io. The cofounders, Denis Mars and Arend Naylor are brilliant and awesome. I helped build the core product last fall, as a consultant, and had a great time working with them.</p>&#13;
<p>Meetings.io enables effortless video chat in the browser. No downloads, no logins necessary; just one click and you're in a video room with a unique URL.  If you choose to login, you can have a persistant room with a custom URL.</p>&#13;
<p>The current product is very cool but the long term vision is incredible and I hope to share it in the coming months.</p>&#13;
<p>While my title will be COO, a better description is <em>the business guy</em>. I'll have my hands in everything and will collaborate with the cofounders on strategy, product, hiring, fundraising, etc.</p>&#13;
<p>I'll be starting this week and it's going to be an amazing journey.</p>
