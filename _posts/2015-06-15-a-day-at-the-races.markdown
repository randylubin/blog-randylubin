<p>Last Sunday, Avital organized a group outing to <a href="http://www.goldengatefields.com/">Golden Gate Fields</a>. I hadn’t been to a horse track in years, but it was a great day!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2448" data-orig-width="3264"><img src="/images/e2b6cb711292463b5a2156b7d07d9657c03c4f7efcd2e291515d4c52a994f1db.jpg" data-orig-height="2448" data-orig-width="3264"></figure><p>We were there for Dollar Day which meant entry, food, and beer was just $1.00. It was a gorgeous day and felt great to be outside. It was easy to get to the track as there was a free shuttle from the North Berkeley BART stop.</p><p>I placed a bunch of tiny bets and ended up winning most races. Overall I did the best from our group and ended up down only 80 cents...</p><p>I don’t think there are any more Dollar Days this summer but I recommend checking out the track if you’re interested in something fun and bit different this summer!</p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="2448" data-orig-width="3264"><img src="/images/baf004d2d29a84fbe9d4d761fdf8ae88f3d2696df4c68f9401258b5aeee9c53a.jpg" data-orig-height="2448" data-orig-width="3264"></figure>
