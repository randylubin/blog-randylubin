description: Building a Django Web App
---

<p>Over spring break I taught myself Django/Python and created a full web app: BrainTrust (currently offline)</p>&#13;
<p>The site isn't pretty, and has fewer features than I'd like, but it works and includes:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>User Accounts and Registration</li>&#13;
<li>Ideas stored in a MySQL database</li>&#13;
<li>Open Comments</li>&#13;
<li>Twitter API Integration</li>&#13;
<li>Bit.ly API Integration</li>&#13;
</ul><p>The last two were pretty unnecessary...</p>&#13;
<p><strong>Learning Django</strong></p>&#13;
<p>After learning Java over winter break (<a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/post/2461663434/learning-to-code" title="Learning Java" target="_blank">earlier post</a>), I quickly picked up Python using <em><a href="http://diveintopython.org/" title="http://diveintopython.org/" target="_blank">Dive into Python</a></em>.  I was able to get my Python abilities to 90% of my Java ability in about two days.  I credit Mehran Sahami for teaching computer science so clearly.</p>&#13;
<p>The next step was to learn Django.  Django is a framework for Python analagous to Rails (Ruby) or Drupal (PHP).  Avoid the official tutorial... I spun my wheels on it for a while before switching to <a href="http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/" title="http://www.djangobook.com/en/2.0/" target="_blank">Django Book</a> which was way clearer.</p>&#13;
<p>I followed the first half of the Django Book tutorial exactly (up until the advanced topics), then I started building BrainTrust following the same steps.  The advanced chapters were useful as I strayed from the tutorial example.</p>&#13;
<p>I built the entire app over the course of a week (~5 hours a day); it felt great to see it up and working.</p>&#13;
