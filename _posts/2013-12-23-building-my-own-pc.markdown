description: "Building my own PC"
---
This weekend I built my own desktop computer. It was the first time I've every built my own PC and relied heavily on my friend Arend for help (thanks Arend!).

It was a fun process but a bit stressful - it seemed like there were a million things that could go catastrophically wrong. This was my first practical exposure to computer hardware / electronics and it was interesting to learn about them more deeply.

After many years of Mac (and PC) laptops - it's nice to have control over my hardware, to be able to easily go under the hood and tinker. I'm hoping to use the new rig as a way to learn a lot more about the hardware aspects of computing.
