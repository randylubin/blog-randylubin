<p>Great <a href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/08/your-car-tracked-the-rapid-rise-of-license-plate-readers/">article</a> by Ars Technica on the use of cameras to read license plates and track cars across communities.</p>&#13;
<p>I've previously mentioned the impact of networks of cameras covering public places in my post on <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/post/18079173691/eagerly-anticipating-google-glasses-social">AR glasses</a> - this is just another sign of it gaining prominence.</p>&#13;
<p>It's just a short jump from it being used by police forces to private companies using to build profiles of potential customers for ad targeting or other, more nefarious use cases.</p>&#13;
<p>As face recognition technology improves, I'm sure we'll see a version of the tech that tracks people, not plates.</p>
