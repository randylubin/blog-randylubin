description: 'Reflection: one year after graduation'

<p>This weekend is the Stanford GSB one year reunion. I figure now's a good time reflect on the time since graduation.</p>&#13;
<h2>Founder Ambitions</h2>&#13;
<p>When I graduated last June, I aimed to start my own company.  I hadn't settled on an idea but knew I loved entrepreneurship.  My intention was to spend three to six months iterating on ideas, trying to find one I liked enough to build a team and raise funding.</p>&#13;
<p>My method was usually something like this:</p>&#13;
<ol><li>Find an awesome thesis (usually based on a new technology or social pattern)</li>&#13;
<li>Generate product/service ideas based on that thesis</li>&#13;
<li>Validate/kill the idea by speaking with potential customers / experts / investors</li>&#13;
<li>Do I fall out of love with the idea?</li>&#13;
<li>Repeat</li>&#13;
</ol><div>I churned through a lot of different ideas and had a great time along the way.  Ultimately, none of the ideas stuck.</div>&#13;
<div></div>&#13;
<div>I'm a big believer in the importance of entrepreneur authenticity. Right now there isn't a problem/opportunity that I'm extremely focused/passionate about conquering. I definitely don't want to start a company for its own sake.  Thus, I will wait until I discover an idea/problem that I'm crazy about.</div>&#13;
<h2>Coding</h2>&#13;
<p>I've continued to push my coding abilities and I'm now confident I can quickly prototype any startup idea I have; that's a really powerful feeling.</p>&#13;
<p>I've written a bit on my growth <a href="http://blog.randylubin.com/post/18617696504/level-up-intermediate-programmer">here</a> so I won't say much else...</p>&#13;
<p>If you're interested in learning yourself, I wrote this for Digital Trends: <a href="http://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/coding-for-the-rest-of-us-why-you-should-learn-and-how-to-get-started/">Coding for the Rest of Us</a></p>&#13;
<p>Here are a few things I've built:</p>&#13;
<ul><li><a href="http://karma.randylubin.com">Karma!</a> - Karma visualizer for Reddit</li>&#13;
<li><a href="http://randylubin.com/ecosystem/">Ecosystem</a> - Dynamic, interactive art</li>&#13;
<li><a href="http://randylubin.com">Personal Homepage</a> - Always iterating on this</li>&#13;
<li><a href="http://ditchtheconference.com">Ditch the Conference</a> - Fake site for Hype Up Weekend</li>&#13;
<li><a href="http://stealthisidea.randylubin.com/">Steal This Idea</a> - My excuse to learn NodeJS/MongoDB</li>&#13;
</ul><h2>Consulting</h2>&#13;
<p>As I was churning through my own startup ideas, I began taking on consulting gigs with other startups. This proved to be great for a few reasons.</p>&#13;
<ul><li>I love working with other entrepreneurs</li>&#13;
<li>A wide array of challenges kept me intellectually stimulated and I got to use a variety of MBA skills</li>&#13;
<li>The income helped me extend my runway</li>&#13;
</ul><div>My consulting now ranges from business/product strategy to product management to coding (front end and back end) and I still still love it.</div>&#13;
<h2>Blogging</h2>&#13;
<p>I've been blogging regularly since January and enjoying it. It helps me articulate my thoughts and improve as a writer. I highly recommend starting.</p>&#13;
<p>Part of my motivation is <a href="http://iron-blogger-sf.com/">Iron Blogger</a>, a group of SF bloggers who commit to writing one post per week; if we don't post, we put $5 in the pot.  Once there's enough money we go drinking.  So far I haven't missed a week!</p>&#13;
<p>I've also written for Digital Trends - a large, professional tech blog.  I enjoyed that experience and hope to write for them again.</p>&#13;
<h2>Living in San Francisco</h2>&#13;
<p>I moved up to SF in August and love it up here.  I'm living in the Mission neighborhood, which is teeming with entrepreneurs / startups.  I've met a ton of awesome people and had a lot of fun. Living up here exposes me to a lot more serendipity than down in South Bay.</p>&#13;
<p>I'm very glad I moved up to the city and will likely be here for a while!</p>&#13;
<h2>What's Next</h2>&#13;
<p>While I still want to start my own company, I'm keeping the bar very high. I hope to find an idea I love but I'm not counting on it happening soon.</p>&#13;
<p>I can continue my consulting indefinitely but am open to joining a company full time.  Again, I'm keeping the bar really high; I need an amazing team with an incredible vision.</p>&#13;
<p>It's been an awesome year since graduation and I'm excited to see what the next year brings.</p>
