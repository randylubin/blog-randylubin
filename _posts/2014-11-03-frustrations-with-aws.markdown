Today my AWS server randomly stopped working because the server it was  virtualized on died. It was a pain to fix and I was lucky to have a backup. 

For my most recent projects I've been hosting on GitHub Pages and storing data on Firebase. I only used AWS for legacy projects and to coordinate WebRTC video for my Karaoke app.

Switching away from AWS is looking increasingly attractive. Other options include [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Terminal](https://www.terminal.com/), and [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/). Anyone have great experiences with them?
