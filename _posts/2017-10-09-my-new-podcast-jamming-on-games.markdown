<p>I’ve launched my new podcast and you can find it at <a href="http://www.jammingongames.com/">JammingOnGames.com</a></p><figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="400" data-orig-width="400"><img src="/images/2b0729c2d1b19af005fce4dac40ff6ac5382eb579a06f607180be2d44301c739.png" data-orig-height="400" data-orig-width="400"></figure><p>The <a href="http://www.jammingongames.com/e/3586a37579ad9a/">first episode</a>&nbsp;has me workshopping my design for the Golden Cobra competition. I had on Nick Punt as a guest and we brainstormed ways to improve the design. It was super helpful and I’m happy with the final design. The game is called Among the Mortals and you can <a href="https://diegeticgames.com/game_files/Among-the-Mortals.pdf">check out the pdf</a>.</p><p>I’m hoping to record a few more episodes this month and release a new one every 2-4 weeks. Should be fun!</p>
