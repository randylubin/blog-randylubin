Following on [last weeks post](http://blog.randylubin.com/post/72444792327/2014-goals):

Last week and this week I'm measuring how I spend my time. I've decided to use [Toggl](https://www.toggl.com/) which has both mobile, web, and desktop apps.

The app is pretty good and allows projects, sub-projects, tags, etc. It's all manual though, as opposed to RescueTime which passively tracks which sites you spend time on. However, Toggl is free.

Just measuring the time I was spending had a positive impact on my productivity. Starting late this week or next, I'll end each day by setting time goals for the following day, broken down by project. Hopefully this will yield even better outputs...
