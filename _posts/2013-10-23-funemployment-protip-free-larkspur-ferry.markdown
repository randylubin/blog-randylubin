description: 'Funemployment Protip: Free Larkspur Ferry'

Today I took advantage of the excellent, free [Larkspur Ferry Deal](http://goldengate.org/MCMPromo/index.php). The ferries are almost empty for reverse commutes so Golden Gate Ferry is allowing free trips to Larkspur in the morning and back in the afternoon.

Larkspur is a town in Marin County, north of SF. In order to get the free return ticket, you need to make a purchase at a local vendor.

Midmorning, I left from the SF Ferry Building when it was foggy and cold. As we sailed north, the sky cleared; Larkspur was warm and sunny.

Across from the Larkspur ferry building is the Marin County Mart - a cute outdoor mall with several restaurants, clothing stores, and a Starbucks. There is tons of outdoor seating and easy wifi.

After a quick lunch, I snagged a shady picnic table, broke out my laptop and coded for several hours. It was great to work outside and I was pretty productive.

Satisfied with my progress, I walked back to the Larkspur Ferry. By now, most of the fog burned off and there were great views of the bay.

It was a perfect break from working in SF and I'll definitely be going again. The current deal lasts until November but I bet they'll bring it back (they tested it out in August, too).
