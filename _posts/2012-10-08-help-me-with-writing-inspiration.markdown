description: Help me with writing inspiration
---

<p>Lately I've been struggling to find interesting topics to write about for my weekly blog posts. I have a few long form essays I've been thinking about but there's nothing I'm passionate about typing up.</p>&#13;
<p>My favorite posts tend to be inspired by interesting conversations I have with others. If we've talked about something recently which you think would make a good post - let me know! If there's something I've brought up in the past that you think the internet would appreciate - bug me to write it up!</p>&#13;
<p>Also - if we happen to disagree on something, it could be fun to write up opposing blog posts to make our case...</p>&#13;
<p>Let me know in the comments or shoot me an email.</p>
