description: Short Story Notes, the Reverse of 'A Sound of Thunder'

<p>Here's another idea for a short story which I may or may not write in full: a reverse version of Bradbury's <em>A Sound of Thunder</em>.</p>&#13;
<p>Bradbury's classic story, in full form <a href="http://www.lasalle.edu/~didio/courses/hon462/hon462_assets/sound_of_thunder.htm">here</a>, is about a group of time travelers who go on a safari to kill a dinosaur and inadvertently change the future by stepping on a butterfly. I'd like to explore the implications of a time traveler who visits the <em>future</em> and realizes how subtle actions he takes in the <em>present </em>can dramatically affect the course of society.</p>&#13;
<p>Some notes on how this might play out:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>The time traveler (TT) takes multiple trips to the same time in the future, but the future is markedly different.</li>&#13;
<li>TT realizes the differences are caused by subtle differences in the present - the TT, is a scientist / entrepreneur at the nexus of several fields and, naturally, at the bleeding edge of capabilities (Time Travel is tough science!) so it's fairly reasonable that TT might have a lot of influence over the future.</li>&#13;
<li>Perhaps, due to anti-paradox laws of time travel, TT is only able to visit versions of the future in which he vanished from existence after using the time machine the present.</li>&#13;
<li>After seeing both great and awful versions of the future, TT decides to find a version of the future that is very positive and stay there permanently to ensure that it happens (i.e. so that TT doesn't mess it up in the present.</li>&#13;
<li>TT says goodbye to everyone in the present and makes his final trip to the future. Depending on if I want a twist ending, I might have TT destroy his way of going back to the present only to realize that what he thought was a positive future is actually quite terrible...</li>&#13;
</ul><p>Broad themes in the story would include:</p>&#13;
<ul><li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_theory">Chaos theory</a> and how slight changes can have huge, unforeseen consequences; just like the original short story</li>&#13;
<li>On how technology is just a tool and can be used for both good and evil. This would play out through the different possible futures illustrate how the same technology can be used and abused.</li>&#13;
</ul>
