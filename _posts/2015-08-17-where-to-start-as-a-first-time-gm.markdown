description: Where to start as a first time GM

<p><i>A friend of mine is going to run an RPG soon, for the first time as a GM (game master). He asked me for advice on a system and the following was my response:</i></p><p>Picking a system is always tricky. The two biggest considerations are theme and complexity. Then, there's decision of whether to use a pre-made module or make things up on the fly.<br></p><p>For a one-shot (stand alone session), I'd avoid a high complexity system as it takes too long for players to spin up on the rules.</p><p>When I started GMing (last December), I used pre-written modules as it reduced some of the creative burden. Since then I've run a bunch of sessions ad hoc, collaboratively creating the adventure on the fly. The ad hoc sessions are a lot of fun but lean heavily on the GMs improve abilities.</p><p>Let me know where you're leaning and I can send followup materials / resources. Here are some things to get you thinking:</p><p>I started with two beginner boxes (starter sets aimed for new GMs)</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-edge-of-the-empire-beginner-game/">Edge of the Empire Beginner Box</a> - Star Wars one-shot with medium complexity and high quality material - a great introduction; I've run it a few times</li><li><a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/tabletop-games/rpg-products/rpg_starterset">D&amp;D 5e Starter Set</a> - I used this for a five-session campaign and it was awesome</li></ul><p>If you're into the Star Wars theme, there are two other beginner boxes, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-age-of-rebellion-beginner-game/">Rebel</a>&nbsp;one and a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/star-wars-force-and-destiny-beginner-game/">Jedi</a>&nbsp;one. I haven't played them but I've heard good things.</p><p>After running those first few campaigns, I ran bunch of sessions using&nbsp;<a href="http://www.dungeonworldsrd.com/">Dungeon World</a>&nbsp;- the system you played. The first several times I used this excellent&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/17ypjtlHfcwqrU_-x4b7o0e8tZ_dN2TiNLUu48MLAw7Y/edit?hl=en&amp;forcehl=1#heading=h.t8tfotiv4mt1">no-prep one-shot guide</a>; there's definitely an art to pulling off a no-prep one-shot and I suggest building up your GMing skill a bit before trying it. I've also ran a few Dungeon World one-shots with modules, including the one we played together,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.johnzo.com/indigo-galleon.pdf">Indigo Galleon</a>. There are plenty more modules out there and I can point you toward some good ones.</p><p>Other things I've tried include:</p><ul><li><a href="http://onesevendesign.com/lasers_and_feelings_rpg.pdf">Lasers and Feelings</a> extremely rules-light no-prep space adventure<br></li><li><a href="http://www.onesevendesign.com/ladyblackbird/">Lady Blackbird</a> magical / steampunk one shot with bit of worldbuilding and story arc. I haven't played it but my friend ran a modified version as a 60's era super spy game.</li><li><a href="http://www.bullypulpitgames.com/games/fiasco/">Fiasco</a> - GMless chaos that plays out like a Coen brothers movie</li></ul>
