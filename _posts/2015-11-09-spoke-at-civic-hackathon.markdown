description: Spoke at Civic Hackathon

This weekend I gave a talk at the Civic Hackathon in SF. The event was run by&nbsp;[Generation Citizen](http://www.generationcitizen.org/)&nbsp;and had middleschoolers and highschoolers working on civic engagement projects and participating in workshops.

My talk was&nbsp;‘Learn to Code!’ and provided an overview of:

* Why coding is awesome
* How to get started
* What projects to choose as you learn
* Where to go from there
 
I had 15-20 students present and by the end they seemed pretty excited to start. Many already had ideas for their first projects. I really enjoyed giving the talk and I hope I inspired the kids to start a life long journey in coding!
