description: Fun-employment Update
---

It's just under two months since I left Jive and I've been busy!

The [first few weeks](http://blog.randylubin.com/post/61539885652/failing-at-fun-employment) were incredibly busy and fun, though not as productive as I wanted. I was much more focused in October and launched two side projects - [Jam-Sync](http://blog.randylubin.com/post/64003279316/side-project-jam-sync) and [Acting Karaoke](http://blog.randylubin.com/post/63355220714/weekend-project-acting-karaoke). I also visited St. Louis for my brother's Parents Weekend and I spent the past week moving to my new apartment. It's been a lot of fun but I'm increasingly ready to jump back into startup mode.

My goal for November is to get focused on legitimate startup ideas - not just side projects. I plan to crank out some blog posts, synthesizing the research / brainstorming I've been doing, and conduct more interviews with experts / potential customers. Hopefully I'll zero in on an awesome problem to solve.
