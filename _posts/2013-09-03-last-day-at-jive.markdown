Today was my last day at Jive - I'm heading back to the startup world!

I've been with Jive since we [sold Meetings.io](http://blog.randylubin.com/post/35532405132/meetings-io-acquisition) last year. I've had a great time working with everyone there - first as PM of Real Time, then on the Corp Dev team - and I learned a lot about how big companies operate.

While the past year has been great - my heart is with early stage startups. I'm going to take some time to explore my own startup ideas and hack on fun side projects. I'll also be keeping an eye out for awesome early-stage companies to join.

I'm not sure where the next few weeks will take me but I know it'll be fun!
