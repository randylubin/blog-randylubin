<p>I’m very excited to head to the Living Games conference in Boston this week. They’ll be a mix of academics and game designers talking about different cultures of play and design techniques. There’s also a one day mini-conference about education and games the day before. It’s my first time going but I’ve heard it’s incredible. I’ll definitely post an update here after!</p>
