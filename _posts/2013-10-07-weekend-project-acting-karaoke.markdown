description: 'Weekend Project: Acting Karaoke'
---

This weekend I built a web app that allows you to act out scenes from movies over video chat. Sort of like karaoke but for acting.

The current version is very light on the functionality and includes only two partial scenes to choose from. Possible extensions include more scenes, improv prompts, and a choose your own adventure mode.

This was very fun to build, though exhausting to do in one weekend. Some of the tools I used include Firebase, Angular.js, and SimpleWebRTC.

Because of WebRTC, it's only usable in Chrome and Firefox, and not on mobile.
