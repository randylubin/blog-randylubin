<p>I started learning computer science / programming a year ago (December 2010).  This past week, I've built two very different web apps and everything is clicking.</p>&#13;
<p>I'll write more posts on the apps when I launch them but one enables people to give away cool product/app/website ideas and the other (in collaboration with <a href="http://www.chrismaury.com" target="_blank">Chris Maury</a>) is a data visualizer for Reddit users (shows them what subreddits give them the most Karma).</p>&#13;
<p>I built both projects in Node.JS and used these other tools:</p>&#13;
<ul><li><a href="http://expressjs.com/">Express</a> (MVC framework for Node)</li>&#13;
<li><a href="http://www.mongodb.org/">MongoDB</a> (NoSQL database)</li>&#13;
<li><a href="http://mbostock.github.com/d3/">D3</a> (data visualization tool)</li>&#13;
<li>Twitter's <a href="http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/">Bootstrap</a> (web design)</li>&#13;
<li>jQuery</li>&#13;
<li>Jade, Stylus and countless other Node plugins</li>&#13;
</ul><p>A few techniques I've picked up along the way</p>&#13;
<ul><li>Using (and understanding!) callbacks in Node for asynchronous functions</li>&#13;
<li>Using http.request() to pull JSON from Reddit and using recursion to keep getting info from Reddit (this was fun!)</li>&#13;
<li>Creating/transforming JSON objects into the perfect form for data viz</li>&#13;
<li>Intermediate jQuery for all sorts of DOM manipulation</li>&#13;
<li>Quickly digging through documentation to understand 3rd party modules</li>&#13;
<li>Using GitHub (for collaboration w/ Chris)</li>&#13;
</ul><p>Everything is clicking and it feels great.  I've had a lot of fun and now feel like I can build just about anything I dream up.</p>&#13;
<p>It's hard to believe it's already been a year of coding... can't wait to see what I learn in the next one.</p>&#13;
<p>Stay tuned for posts when I launch the new projects... They'll also be up on GitHub.</p>&#13;
