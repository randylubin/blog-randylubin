Short update today. I haven't been putting in nearly as much time as I'd like into Nation Building.

This week I built the guts of the Player Decision engine. This allows me to present a decision to the player and have them choose among multiple choices.

The basics are up on the site now, though the choices are just tied to moving onto the next phase. Next step is creating a list of different decisions, random encounters, etc...

As always you can check out my progress [here](http://nationbuilding.randylubin.com/) or look at the code [here](https://github.com/randylubin/Nation-Building/tree/master/Band%20Expansion)
