It's been two years since I updated my website / blog design; I spend some time this week updating the look and unifying the blog with my main site.

The new look is cleaner and more orderly than the old one. The blog now looks just like the main site (though it is hosted on Tumblr). I'm also using different pages for each section of the site, rather than a single page app.

Please let me know if you have feedback! I'll probably be making minor tweaks and would love your input.

The other big change is behind the scenes - I switched the hosting to GitHub Pages. I still have my AWS box and use it for some side projects but it tends to occasionally break. GitHub Pages is super easy to use and highly reliable.
