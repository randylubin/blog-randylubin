<p>I'm continuing my programming journey and delving into web development.</p>&#13;
<p>Check out my site in progress here: <a target="_blank" href="http://randylubin.com">randylubin.com</a></p>&#13;
<p>Along the way I'm learning:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>LAMP Stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP)</li>&#13;
<li>Vim</li>&#13;
<li>Python/Django</li>&#13;
</ul><p>I've build a webpage before but never a website.  Today I learned <em>server side includes </em>which allows me to have one file each for the header and footer across the entire site (i.e. I can change every page's header or footer by altering one file).</p>&#13;
<p>At some point I will try to create a blog from the ground up but for now I'll stick to this Tumblr.</p>
