description: Quick Update on Various Games
---

It's been a few weeks so I wanted to give an update on the various game projects in which I'm involved.

## Nation Building
I'm still working on this but haven't been able to put a lot of time into it. First I was distracted by my [Listserve Project](http://blog.randylubin.com/post/45633748006/results-from-the-listserve-experiment) and now I've been involved with [5322](http://brosephstalin.com/2013/03/12/5322-an-e-mail-based-mmo/), which I'll talk about in a second.

I'm still happy with how Nation Building is progressing. The basic engine is in place but I want to add a few more features before I put the alpha online. The first version is just going to be growing your band until you become a post-agricultural tribe. If I find the time to work, it should get there in a week or two.

## 5322

A few weeks ago, [Tim Hwang](http://brosephstalin.com/) decided to run an email driven MMO. I was excited to play it but even more thrilled when he asked me to help run it. We have about 40 players now and a federated network of game-runners. Designing and running the game has been a tremendous amount of fun and I'm excited to share all the details once the story resolves next week. We'll definitely do a behind the scenes / how-to guide once it's completed.
