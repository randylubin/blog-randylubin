description: Go Play ‘The Witness’

<p>It’s a bit late but I don’t want to miss a week of Iron Blogger so I’ll keep this short. There’s a phenomenal new computer game out called <a href="http://the-witness.net/">The Witness</a>. It’s a puzzle game, exploring variations on the theme of mazes - but that doesn’t do it justice. The puzzles are interesting and challenging and the game does a fantastic job of gradually teaching you its visual language. The setting is a beautiful island imbued with mystery and the graphics are great.</p><p>It’s one of my favorite games in a while - go grab it now if you have a PC or PS4.</p>
