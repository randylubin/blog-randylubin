<p>This week I started my second season of Tai Chi with <a href="http://sfrecpark.org/recreation-community-services/find-a-class/">SF Rec and Park</a>. SFR&amp;P has a ton of inexpensive classes and this winter I tried my first one with weekly Tai Chi – only $16 total for eight classes. This week was the beginning of the spring course.</p><p>I first encountered Tai Chi during my time at FactoryX when the team would take Chi Gong / Tai Chi breaks in the afternoon. This course is pretty structured and we’re slowly working out way through the 64 step&nbsp;<a href="http://www.chinahand.com/taichi/long_form.htm">Guang Ping Yang Tai Chi Chuan</a>. I find it very relaxing but still a nice bit of exercise; I think it’s helping with my flexibility.</p><p>I’m excited to keep it up year round. We’re told it’ll take about two years to learn the full 64 steps but I’m just enjoying the process!</p>
