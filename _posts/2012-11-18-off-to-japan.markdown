description: Off to Japan

<p>It's Thanksgiving in a few days so naturally I'm off to Japan!</p>&#13;
<p>My roommate Adam scored some cheap tickets so we're setting off tomorrow for a week-long trip.</p>&#13;
<p>Our schedule is almost totally inchoate but we're flying into Tokyo and out of Osaka. Along the way we might drop by:</p>&#13;
<ul><li>Kyoto</li>
<li>Nara</li>
<li>Hiroshima</li>
</ul><p>We probably won't hit all of them but we have an unlimited rail pass so we have tons of flexibility.</p>&#13;
<p>We're also hoping to stay a night in some small fishing village, just to try something different; if you have any suggestions, let me know!</p>&#13;
<p>Earlier, I sent a blast on Twitter / Facebook to find some amazing people to meet up with; it looks like we'll be hanging out with the Japanese start-up crowd in Tokyo; should be great! Also makes me appreciate the power of social media to facilitate last minute awesomeness.</p>&#13;
<p>Internet should be plentiful so hopefully I'll be posting during the trip. If not, look forward to a big update post when I get back! </p>
