description: 'Building Diegetic Games: Blog and Learning Resources'

<p>I’ve been working on the site for my game studio <a href="diegeticgames.com">Diegetic Games</a>&nbsp;and made some major progress this weekend.</p><p>I’m hosting the site on github pages and I’m now using <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> which makes content management super easy. Jekyll lets me use templates for different page types and includes for the head, header, and footer. It auto assembles a main blog page and I can write my posts in markdown. It was really easy to get Jekyll set up.</p><p>I’m going to start shifting some of my game writing and announcements over to the Diegetic Games blog which you can find at:&nbsp;<a href="http://diegeticgames.com/blog/">Diegetic Games Blog</a></p><p>I’m also going to start adding learning resources for folks getting into story games and game design. The first page is up here:&nbsp;<a href="http://diegeticgames.com/learn/">Learn about Story Games</a>&nbsp;- it’s an intro to storytelling games, RPGs and LARPs.</p>
