---

This month I've been learning to dance. For years, I've been totally clueless on the dance floor. Many of my SF friends have been doing swing or blues dancing and loving it.

I signed up for a four session Lindy Hop program with a few friends. It's been meeting every Wednesday in the Mission and the lessons are geared for beginners. There are swing lessons afterwards but I haven't made it there yet.

So far I'm enjoying the lessons and it's not as tricky as I expected. I'm not sure I'll take more lessons next month but I probably will at some point. I highly recommend giving it a shot!
