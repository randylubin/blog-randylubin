description: Innovation in Nepal?
---

As I mentioned earlier - [I'm heading to India next month](http://blog.randylubin.com/post/79847846814/going-to-india)! I'm still solidifying my travel plans but it looks like I'll also be spending some time in Nepal at the end of May.

Whenever I travel I like to check out the local startup scene. If you know of any cool innovation happening in Kathmandu or Pokhara please let me know!

Otherwise the agenda is pretty up in the air - though I'll likely trek a little bit of the Annapurna Circuit. Feel free to send suggestions my way.
