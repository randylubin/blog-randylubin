<p>I've been messing around with <a href="http://processing.org/">Processing</a>, a cool programming language for quickly developing dynamic digital art.</p>
<p>For my first experiment, I decided to code up an ecosystem. &nbsp;You can check it out in this Java applet <a href="http://randylubin.com/ecosystem/index.html">here</a>.</p>
<p><figure data-orig-height="200" data-orig-width="274"><img src="/images/96e20725796391edd502b21c5850fb3f55d8749b7987eefbb6c56fd942c324c3.png" data-orig-height="200" data-orig-width="274"></figure></p>
<p>The green bits are algae. &nbsp;The blue guys are&nbsp;herbivores, they eat the algae. The red guys are carnivores, they eat the blue guys.</p>
<p>Blue and red die if they don't eat often enough. &nbsp;If they eat enough, they'll reproduce (split in two). &nbsp;If a creature dies, it decomposes into algae.</p>
<p>You can click to place additional blue guys.</p>
<p>I had a fun time coding it up. &nbsp;If I return to it, I might enable evolution (randomized, inheritable traits) and make it look a bit nicer.</p>
