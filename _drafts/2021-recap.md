title: 2021 Recap
description: ''

---
2021 went by super fast for us! We're happy and healthy and here's a recap of what we've up to.

## Life

Some of this year's highlights were when we got to hang out with family and friends once we were all vaccinated.

### Family

My brother Greg and his wife Emily got married in August and it was phenomenal having the immediate family together, in person for the first time in years.

Another highlight was flying easy to spend a week with my grandparents – I got to be with them every day for uninterrupted, quality time and it was amazing. Not seeing them has been one of the hardest parts of the pandemic.

### Nature

2021 definitely cemented our love of Point Reyes, just north of the city. We stayed up there twice, in a little cottage on Tomales Bay and had a great time hiking and taking in the elephant seals, pelicans, and elk.

### Other hobbies

We've dabbled in a few other hobbies this year. Avital got into pottery and took a few classes over video chat. I experimented with digital music synthesis and production and had a lot of fun learning the fundamentals.

## On to 2022

We haven’t done too much planning for 2021, given the massive uncertainty, but we’re sure it will be full of creative projects, hikes, and digital catch-ups with friends and family.

On that note – please reach out! We haven’t been great about proactively scheduling calls but we always get excited when old friends reach out to chat. Shoot us an email and we’ll get something on the calendar.
