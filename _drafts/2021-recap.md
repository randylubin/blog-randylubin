2021 went by super fast for us! We're happy and healthy and here's what our year looked like:

## Life

Some of this year's highlights were when we got to hang out with family and friends once we were all vaccinated. It was amazing to return to in person gatherings after a long time of virtual and distant hangouts.

### Family

My brother Greg and his wife Emily got married in August and it was phenomenal having the immediate family together, in person for the first time in years.

Another highlight was flying easy to spend a week with my grandparents – I got to be with them every day for uninterrupted, quality time and it was amazing. Not seeing them has been one of the hardest parts of the pandemic.

### Nature

2021 definitely cemented our love of Point Reyes, just north of the city. We stayed up there twice, in a little cottage on Tomales Bay and had a great time hiking and taking in the elephant seals, pelicans, and elk.

### Other hobbies

We've dabbled in a few other hobbies this year. Avital got into pottery and took a few classes over video chat. I experimented with digital music synthesis and production and had a lot of fun learning the fundamentals.

## Consulting

My work life has been busy with a mix of consulting and foresight game design (more on that in a minute). A can't talk about much of my consulting because it's under NDA but I did get to work with DARPA on the [SemaFor](https://www.darpa.mil/news-events/2021-03-02), trying to detect and deter algorithmic propaganda.

I also got paid to help [Amble Studio](http://amble.studio/) with their Story Synth powered games which was very exciting for me! Separately I advised a consulting firm on some educational games they were making, in a way that bridged my strategy and game design backgrounds.

## Leveraged Play and foresight games

This was a busy year on the foresight games front, though I can't share all of the details yet.

In the spring we ran our game ["Money City" for Mozfest](https://blog.randylubin.com/serious-games-future-of-money-run-at-mozfest) - Mozilla's annual festival. Participants explored the future of web monetization and payments and it was super fun.

I won an award this summer: [Next Generation Foresight Partners: Innovative Methods](https://blog.randylubin.com/award-next-generation-foresight-practitioner-innovative-methods) and it's been fun getting to know foresight folks around the world and talk to them about foresight and games.

I also ran a couple [foresight games + creative writing](https://blog.randylubin.com/foresight-workshop-games-creative-writing) workshops, where participants played a worldbuilding game and then wrote flash fiction. They were a delight to facilitate and I hope to run more next year.

## Avital Tours

Avital had a very busy year with her company, with plenty of ups and downs as we tried to adapt to the shifting pandemic. Ultimately it ended up being a good year but it was a rollercoaster of a year. By the end of year she had launched a bunch of new product lines, brought back in-person in SF and NY.

One of the product lines was a water tasing experience and it was inspired by Avital's obsession with water this year. She even became a certified water sommelier!

One idea for a product line that didn't happen was a charcuterie chalet (like a ginger bread house). She didn't launch it for customers but we did it for her company holiday party and we had a blast.

We haven’t done too much planning for 2021, given the massive uncertainty, but we’re sure it will be full of creative projects, hikes, and digital catch-ups with friends and family.

On that note – please reach out! We haven’t been great about proactively scheduling calls but we always get excited when old friends reach out to chat. Shoot us an email and we’ll get something on the calendar.
