I'm thrilled to announce the a new program offering microgrants for game designers to make games in Story Synth. The program is being administered by [Big Bad Con](https://www.bigbadcon.com/) and is funded by [Grant for the Web](https://www.grantfortheweb.org/) â€“ you can find out all the details and apply by visiting [Big Bad Con's Grant Page](https://www.bigbadcon.com/story-synth-microgrants/).

There is $30,000 in grant funding, which will be given out in 100 microgrants of $300 each. The grants are all going to designers from marginalized background, to support them in making Story Synth games. The games will all be monetized using the new web monetization protocol, which is being promoted by Grant for the Web.

Big Bad Con is a wonderful Bay Area non-profit that organizes an annual storytelling game convention as well as many related events and programs. Their team is full of wonderful, thoughtful folks and I'm very excited to partner with them for this grant series.
