title: Mid-2020 Update
description: What we've been up to for the last 8 months, personally and professionally

---
Looks like my last blog post was December 2019 and now it's September 2020 â€“ it's been quite the year so far! This post will be an update on what we've been up to and how we're doing. The short of it: we're happy, healthy, and super busy.

## Enduring the Pandemic

We quarantined pretty early at the beginning of March and have barely left the house since. It's been a relatively smooth adjustment, all things considered, though we went from almost never cooking in February to cooking pretty much every meal. I can't say my cooking skills have improved too much but Avital makes an excellent risotto and our Instant-pot was one of the best panic-buys of the year.

We're deeply appreciative of our house and, after traveling a ton last fall, it's actually been nice to stay home and appreciate it so much. This summer we made a few upgrades that have added a lot: we built a large pantry to support our new cooking-filled lifestyle, and we bought some patio furniture so we can safely have folks over for socially-distant hangouts.

Though it's nearly seven months into the pandemic, we've adapted well to changes and new routines and I'm optimistic we can keep it up for another year if need be.

However, we've been pretty bad at proactive social reach out and we're trying to get better. If it's been a while since we caught up, reach out and we can find time for a video chat or patio hang!
