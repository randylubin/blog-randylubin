title: Mid-2020 Update
description: What we've been up to for the last 8 months, personally and professionally

---
Looks like my last blog post was December 2019 and now it's September 2020 – it's been quite the year so far! This post will be an update on what we've been up to and how we're doing. The short of it: we're happy, healthy, and super busy.

## Enduring the Pandemic

We quarantined pretty early at the beginning of March and have barely left the house since. It's been a relatively smooth adjustment, all things considered, though we went from almost never cooking in February to cooking pretty much every meal. I can't say my cooking skills have improved too much but Avital makes an excellent risotto and our Instant-pot was one of the best panic-buys of the year.

We're deeply appreciative of our house and, after traveling a ton last fall, it's actually been nice to stay home and appreciate it so much. This summer we made a few upgrades that have added a lot: we built a large pantry to support our new cooking-filled lifestyle, and we bought some patio furniture so we can safely have folks over for socially-distant hangouts.

Though it's nearly seven months into the pandemic, we've adapted well to changes and new routines and I'm optimistic we can keep it up for another year if need be.

However, we've been pretty bad at proactive social reach out and we're trying to get better. If it's been a while since we caught up, reach out and we can find time for a video chat or patio hang!

## Work, work, work

Back in January, I started advising [Remotion](http://remotion.com/) – an early stage startup focused on helping remote-first teams stay connected through quick video chat (and much more). Once it became clear that the whole world was going remote, I jumped in as a full-time consultant to help them launch their public beta. The launch went well and I loved working with the team so I ended up joining full time.

Since them I've been running their business operations and growth initiatives and it's been both fun and meaningful. I think our product is fantastic and so does Avital – her company was in the Alpha test before I started consulting! If you're on a team that uses macOS and you're looking to better have quick chats to solve problems and be more creative, give us a shot! I'd love your feedback...

Avital has also been incredibly busy; in early March she completely reinvented her company from in-person experiences to virtual events. She has a great [blog post](https://medium.com/@avitalungar/how-i-reinvented-our-company-in-5-days-24353c12819f) about how her team navigated the crisis and she's due to write a follow-up post soon. They did a fantastic job of iterating their way into a new business model and are thriving. It's been awesome to see them pull through the initial crisis even stronger than they were before.
