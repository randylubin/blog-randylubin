title: 'Serious Game: Imagining Health Futures'

Last summer, Jason Morningstar and I co-designed Imagining Health Futures, a game about the future of health and adolescence. We made the game in support of UNICEF's Office of Innovation. Here's a quick overview about the game and our design choices.

Here are the quick links to the game resources:

## The Goal

The main goal of the game was to better understand the preferences and expectations of today's youth and what might the future of health and well being for 20-year-olds be in 2030-2050. Another goal was for the game to produce outputs that might inspire science fiction short stories by professional authors that would further share insights generated during the game.

## The Game

The game itself was built to be played with 1-2 facilitators and 3-6 teenagers in \~2 hours over video chat. We broke the game into four stages to ease the participants into playing and to best capture the output. Here's an overview of the four stages with some commentary on our design decisions.

### Worldbuilding

We opened up play with a worldbuilding round which served a few purposes:

* Start aligning on a shared version of the future (in the year 2035), which will be used for the rest of the game
* Start play with low stakes creative decision as the players get to know each other
* Create space for the players to express their interests and preferences around possible trends.

We explored a variety of worldbuilding approaches and knew that we wanted players to engage with different types of trends but especially those related to health. We ended up distilling down possible trends to six, in two groups:

* Non-health trends: climate change, justice and human rights, economy
* Health trends: health technology, health access, and health engagement

We had the players then choose one trend from each group to be clearly negative; these trends would play a key role in influencing the rest of play. We presented the trends to the players via fake magazine covers, which Jason did a phenomenal job designing!
