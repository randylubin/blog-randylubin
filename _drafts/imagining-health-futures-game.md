title: Imagining Health Futures Game
description: ''

---
Last summer, Jason Morningstar and I co-designed Imagining Health Futures, a game about the future of health and adolescence. We made the game in support of UNICEF's Office of Innovation. Here's a quick overview about the game and our design choices.

Here are the quick links to the game resources:

## The Goal

The main goal of the game was to better understand the preferences and expectations of today's youth and what might the future of health and well being for 20-year-olds be in 2030-2050. Another goal was for the game to produce outputs that might inspire science fiction short stories by professional authors that would further share insights generated during the game.
