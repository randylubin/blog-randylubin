title: 2020 Recap
description: An overview of my 2020, especially focused on the second half of the
  year.

With just a few hours left in 2020, here's a final update on our year. I'll mostly focus on the last few months as I wrote a [Mid-2020 Update](https://blog.randylubin.com/mid-2020-update) in September.

## Life

Avital and I are healthy and happy, if a bit exhausted. We are super fortunate in that we can just hunker down and never leave the house (except for hikes). We're also lucky in that all our family and close friends have been able to be cautious as well and stay healthy – hopefully that continues!

We've mostly been busy with work but have found time to play storytelling games, play music together (we're learning klezmer), and have plenty of zoom catch-ups and some patio hang-outs with friends (though never enough).

## Work

I spent over half the year helping Remotion (a video chat startup) launch a public beta, raise a series A, prepare for scale. After helping with a successful press push, I left in October and they seem to be on good trajectory.

On the 'serious games' front – I designed (with Jason Morningstar) a game for UNICEF on the future of healthcare and adolescence and ran (with Mike Masnick) an updated version of our Election Threatcast game. I covered both of these in more depth in the [mid-2020 update](https://blog.randylubin.com/mid-2020-update). Since then we've designed and ran two more serous games.

In November we ran Hindsight 2030, a game 

Avital's company has had an amazing but intense year. They moved fast in the beginning of the pandemic and built an incredible set of virtual culinary experiences that have been a huge hit for corporate events. The last few months have been about scaling the team and processes and I've had fun jumping in to help. Amongst other things, I've built no-code tooling and automation to enable them to handle the massive volume of events and shipments, and to catch problems early on, before they blow up.
