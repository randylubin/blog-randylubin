description: ''

---
Over the past two weeks we've run a game about the Future of Money at Mozilla's conference MozFest. The game was sponsored by [Grant for the Web](grantfortheweb.org) and I co-designed it with Mike Masnick and Leigh Beadon of [Techdirt](https://www.techdirt.com/) / [Copia](https://copia.is/). This post will give and overview of the game provide some insight into the design choices we made.
