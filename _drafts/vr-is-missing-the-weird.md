title: VR is Missing the Weird

When I bought the Oculus Quest back in June, I thought our VR future had arrived and that we are on the verge of mass adoption. Now I'm not so sure, and the limits have nothing to do with the hardware and everything to do with the platform's walled garden approach.

# Initial Hopes

I've been following VR for over a decade and the Quest brings a high quality consumer experience that I thought was still several years away. It has:

* Room scale, which helps with immersion and cuts down on motion sickness
* No cable and very easy set up in new rooms
* A relatively accessible price of $400 (comparable to a video game console)

I've probably put a couple dozen friends and family members (some in their 80s) through the brilliantly designed onboarding experience and all of them were blown away and took to it quickly. Even the older folks, who were decidedly not tech savvy, were able to grok the interface and dive into the experiences.

My hunch was that the Quest would be the breakout hit of the 2019 holiday season, leading to a feedback loop that attracted more developers which would make the platform even more attractive to consumers. The Quest did sell out in December and it looks like new orders will start shipping in February. Facebook had predicted 1.9 million units sold in 2019.

Despite the high sales – there's a distinct risk that the Quest becomes a novelty that collects dust after some strong initial use.
