title: 2022 Recap
description: 'What I was up to in 2022: Curio, Games, and more!'

---
2022 was a huge year for us – all three of us! Here's what we've been up to:

## Family

Curio Rav Lubin was born in March – he's almost ten months old now – and we've loved growing with him over the past year. He's incredibly happy most of the time and quick to smile and laugh. His face is deeply expressive, especially his eyebrows, and we love seeing a small window into his mind. In the last few weeks he's gotten very quick at crawling and climbing (on us, on furniture, on toys). It's wild to see friends' kids who are only a year older and think about how much more will change in the very near future.

Parenting has been a blast – especially since I get to do it with Avital. We're having nonstop fun and it just keeps getting better. One surprise for me, shortly after Curio was born, was that I kept bursting into improvised song about his day. I'm not particularly into musicals but making up songs was a way to connect with Curio and to embrace the omnipresent repetition of those early months. It turns out that I'm not alone in this and our friend Kathryn Hymes ended up writing an article for the Atlantic on the topic (featuring me and Curio!): [What Babies Hear When You Sing to Them]().

We've had tons of great family time beyond Curio too, with my parents flying in once a month and Avital's parents visiting at least once a week. It's super fun to see them spending time with their grandchild!

## Work

### Leveraged Play

I had a very busy year on the serious game front, mostly focused on "foresight games" that explore the future.

#### Startup Trail

In April, we launched [Startup Trail](https://startuptrail.engine.is/) ([blog](https://blog.randylubin.com/new-game-startup-trail)) a browser based game that explores the intersection of startups and tech policy. Players face a series of dilemmas as they grow their company from founding to exit (or bankruptcy). The game was warmly received, with 10,000s of folks playing the game; we also got covered in [The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/28/23045333/startup-trail-game-oregon). I'm thrilled with how the game turned out and we'll be making more browser based games in 2023.

#### United Nations Election Game

I've also spent most of the year working with the United Nations on a foresight game to explore threats and opportunities around elections. We ran pilot sessions in Southeast Asia in late spring and then created a generalized guide for how to adapt the game for other national contexts – the guide should launch early this year and I'll post about it when it's live. Working with the United Nations was a treat – it's important that my games are impactful (not just fun) and the UN is a strong vector for affecting positive change.

#### Talks, Workshops, and More

I gave a handful of talks and workshops throughout 2022 and I've enjoyed honing my "Why Foresight Games?" pitch. 

#### Launching the Foresight Games Community

### Avital Tours / Edible Architecture

Avital created a new brand this fall, [Edible Architecture](https://ediblearchitecture.com/), which sells the first commercially available Charcuterie Chalet Kit. I've enjoyed watching her prototype and launch this new business line and seeing her go from concept to reality in just a few, quick months – her kits have even gone viral on social media!
