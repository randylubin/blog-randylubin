title: 2022 Recap
description: 'What I was up to in 2022: Curio, Games, and more!'

---
2022 was a huge year for us – all three of us! Here's what we've been up to:

## Family

Curio Rav Lubin was born in March – he's almost ten months old now – and we've loved growing with him over the past year. He's incredibly happy most of the time and quick to smile and laugh. His face is deeply expressive, especially his eyebrows, and we love seeing a small window into his mind. In the last few weeks he's gotten very quick at crawling and climbing (on us, on furniture, on toys). It's wild to see friends' kids who are only a year older and think about how much more will change in the very near future.

Parenting has been a blast – especially since I get to do it with Avital. We're having nonstop fun and it just keeps getting better. One surprise for me, shortly after Curio was born, was that I kept bursting into improvised song about his day. I'm not particularly into musicals but making up songs was a way to connect with Curio and to embrace the omnipresent repetition of those early months. It turns out that I'm not alone in this and our friend Kathryn Hymes ended up writing an article for the Atlantic on the topic (featuring me and Curio!): [What Babies Hear When You Sing to Them]().

We've had tons of great family time beyond Curio too, with my parents flying in once a month and Avital's parents visiting at least once a week. It's super fun to see them spending time with their grandchild!
